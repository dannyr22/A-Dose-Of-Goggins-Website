title: About a dose of Goggins
---
If you're on this site then you probably know a bit about David Goggins already.

I﻿'ve struggled to stay fit many times in the past and during the covid lockdown I was finally able to do it properly. What I've noticed about myself is that the first two weeks are easy, working out is easy, making the time is easy, eating healthily is easy. But once the initial determination starts to dwindle and things in life start to get in the way, I start to push all of the positive stuff to the back of my mind.

G﻿enerally speaking I've always gone through peaks and troughs physically and mentally. The purpose of this app is get you out of the troughs.

N﻿ow I've always liked listening to motivational speakers and when they pop-up on Youtube I'll always give them a watch whether it's Tony Robinson, or whoever, but if I'm in a trough then hell no if it's David Goggins. One day I thought why do I always skip him? And the answer is, because he challenges the listener. I know that if I watch a David Goggins video then I'm going for a mother-fuckin' run, I know that at that moment I am not brave or strong enough to handle the heat that he brings, so I skip. The problem with that is that it's like what Goggins says, "We have a little voice in our head which wants us to be a little bitch". He challenges us to tell that voice to shut the fu*k up.  

T﻿hat's why I created this app, because sometimes when you're in that trough, we need a quick dose of Goggins to get us to wake up, stop being a lazy b*itch and lace 'em up.
